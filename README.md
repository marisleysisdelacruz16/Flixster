### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The topics in the labs guided me through the steps I needed to complete the assignment. I felt that separating the assignment into parts such as Javascript and API helped a lot and allowed me to see how I would incorporate it into the assignment. I didn't feel unprepared to complete the assignment, just a little overwhelmed. 

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I would've implemented the stretch features. I also would've made the logo of flickster the refresh button instead of the button I have now. Some additional changes would've been to remove the load more button when searching for a movie, and adding an image for movies that didn't have images. 

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I was able to implement all of the required features which I am very proud of myself for because I was struggling with getting the data from the API to show for a long time. I like the layout I have and the grid worked really well. One feature that a peer did that I would like to try is including a pop up for the movies that includes a trailer.
